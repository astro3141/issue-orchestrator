"""May this issue be retried, and are its stored inputs still usable?

Split out of ``PublishRecoveryService``, which owns in-flight submission state
(tokens, tombstones, the pending slot) under a lock. These questions own none of
that: they are decisions about the BOARD and about the durable retry locators,
plus the one repair those locators may need before a republish can read them.

Keeping them here makes the service's ``retry_publish`` read as decide → recover
or submit, and makes the admission rules testable without a runner, a lock, or a
background job. The one check that genuinely needs owner state — "is a
submission already pending for this issue" — deliberately stays in the service.
