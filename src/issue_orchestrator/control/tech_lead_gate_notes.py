"""Operator-facing gate-note rendering for tech-lead ``create_issue`` decisions.

The planner (`tech_lead_decision_actions.py`) translates each typed
``ProposalDedupGate`` outcome into an action; when an outcome gates the create,
the *presence* of a reason string is what gates it (never a bare boolean), so
every gated issue explains itself. This module owns the single mapping from a
typed dedup outcome to that explanation, plus the intra-decision batch note and
the composition of the two, so both the standalone gate path and the
sibling-dedup path render evidence identically and no candidate/score/reason is
ever lost (#6883 review).
