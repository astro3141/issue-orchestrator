"""What a terminal with an unreadable pending-work claim means (#6999 F6/F12).

A terminal whose stored claim cannot be read is the one restoration outcome that
must not be handled quietly. The session may still be alive and doing queued
work nobody can now name: admitting it would let its completion settle as
holding no claim and silently discard that request, and dropping it without a
word would leave a running agent nobody is watching.

This owner exists because that escalation is NOT the tech-lead launch-exhaustion
escalation it originally borrowed (#6999 F12). The two disagree on every rule
that matters:

* provenance — a quarantine can belong to review, rework, validation-retry or
  tech-lead work, so a comment written in the vocabulary of a failure
  investigation is simply wrong for most of them;
* clearing — the tech-lead lifecycle clears its marker as soon as ANY session
  for the issue is active, but a quarantined terminal is deliberately absent
  from ``active_sessions`` while still running, so a healthy sibling session on
  the same issue would silently retract the warning;
* identity — a quarantine belongs to one RUN, not to an issue. Two runs of the
  same issue can be quarantined independently, and re-discovering one every 30
  seconds must not re-comment.

So it keeps its own durable per-run marker, applies its own labels and comment,
and publishes the event only after that durable surface has committed. A failed
apply leaves the quarantine recorded-but-unescalated, which is what makes the
next orphan scan retry instead of treating the failure as final.

What an operator READS is assembled from two enumerable tables, not from
branches (#209). The cause answers "which situation is this run in"; the claim's
:class:`~..ports.pending_work_claim_store.ClaimReadability` answers "what is
true of its record". They vary independently - an unrestorable live run can hold
an intact claim, an intact one this build simply cannot interpret, a damaged
one, or one a store fault stopped anybody from looking at - and folding the
second into the first is how a claim written by a newer build got announced as
unrecoverable.

Both halves are therefore durable, as one
:class:`~..ports.pending_work_claim_store.AnnouncedStory`. What an operator has
been told is only correctable if the orchestrator remembers all of what it said.

# finding for it could only do so for the readabilities it was written beside.
