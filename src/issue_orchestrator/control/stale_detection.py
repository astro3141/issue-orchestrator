"""Detecting work the orchestrator *thinks* it owns but does not.

Two independent staleness questions asked once per tick, before planning:
an issue labelled in-progress with no running session, and an issue holding
a claim that has expired or vanished. Both are pure observation — they read
state and announce what they found, and the planner decides what to do about
it — so they live together here rather than among the tick's sequencing.

    Staleness is a RECONCILIATION question, not a scheduling one — "does this

    is working on it, which is when the duplicate-launch guard has already
    dropped it from the launchable queue. Asking it of
    ``cached_queue_issues`` alone therefore never reaches the issues that need
    it most: a candidate that ended ``validation_failed`` left the queue on the
    same tick it left ``active_sessions``, so its ``in-progress`` label stayed
    forever and only a restart (whose ``session_history`` starts empty) could
    clear it (#195).

    The queue owner names the extra issues, and names only the ones no other
    owner is answering for — a running session, a live control operation and
    the awaiting-merge presentation record all stay out. Its result is disjoint
    from the queue by construction, so the two concatenate without
    deduplicating.
