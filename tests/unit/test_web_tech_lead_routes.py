"""The dashboard tech-lead command surface stays thin and truthful (#6994).

Three properties are pinned here, because each one is a way the feature could
quietly go wrong:

1. **Contract**: every request and response validates through the generated UI
   OpenAPI models — no hand-rolled JSON on either side of the wire.
2. **Delegation**: the route hands ONE typed command to the run-admission owner
   and reports its verdict. It never touches the pending queue, never launches,
   and never shells out to the one-shot ``orchestrator health-review`` CLI
   (which would take the repository lock out from under the running engine).
3. **Truthfulness**: each typed outcome maps to an HTTP status the dashboard can
   act on — idempotent successes read as success, refusals read as refusals.
